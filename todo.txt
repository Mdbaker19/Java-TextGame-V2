more items from shop ( armour and weapons )

steal speed based ( ? )

mp currently not being used unless successful cast ( ? )

allocate stat points at level up ( ? )

spell or item to prevent enemy from healing ( ? )

======ISSUES======
issue with poison damage even when checking inventory or scanning enemy     ==> quick fix implemented for now ( undo the damage ) -> really not sure what else to do

better stat development ( seems to be okay ish for now ) game needs some balancing, end game needs testing, can be played with in the save state

if you save and reload a file with a certain amount of "days past" in your gambler account then you lose that interest. ( patched from it being counted for multiple times )

=======WORK IN PROGRESS=======
NEW DAMAGE FORMULA, SEEMS OKAY FOR NOW
