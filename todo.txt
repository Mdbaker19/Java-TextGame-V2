======ISSUES======
issue with poison damage even when checking inventory or scanning enemy     ==> quick fix implemented for now ( undo the damage )

better stat development ( seems to be okay ish for now ) game needs some balancing, end game is unplayable for both sides haha => a little better now

enemy with over 100 defense will default to taking only 5 damage, end game issue ^^ => bomb, poison, confuse, summon only ways of playing end game ( spell to reduce enemy damage = > short term fix )

=====EXPLOITS=======
check enemy can undo sleep
