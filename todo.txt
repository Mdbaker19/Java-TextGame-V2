more items from shop ( armour and weapons )

different enemy ( resist to magic or normal attacks )

enemy can heal randomly ( amount based on level ( ? ) low chance every turn, takes its turn )

sleep effect ( 2 - 3 turns ) have an item for it too

options and maybe a load save from file reader ( ? )

======ISSUES======
issue with poison damage even when checking inventory or scanning enemy     ==> quick fix implemented for now ( undo the damage )

better stat development ( seems to be okay ish for now ) game needs some balancing, end game is unplayable for both sides haha

some sort of bug in late game with a boss fight ( ? ) confuse was on him but still prompt for you were hit for this much when it was not a miss

stats flow over 100% range
