======ISSUES======
issue with poison damage even when checking inventory or scanning enemy     ==> quick fix implemented for now ( undo the damage ) -> really not sure what else to do

better stat development ( seems to be okay ish for now ) game needs some balancing, end game needs testing, can be played with in the save state


=======WORK IN PROGRESS=======
NEW DAMAGE FORMULA, SEEMS OKAY FOR NOW
