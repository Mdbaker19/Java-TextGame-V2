Re make of the JAVA text game
Looking for feedback and ideas!                                                                                   
When playing the game a "gameStates.txt" file will be created, and you can save your progress to that file, this is ignored on GitHub. You can have one save at a time with each new "push" overwriting the current data in the gameStates file
